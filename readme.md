# Lyrebird Handwriting Generation Test

This is a partial submission for the Lyrebird handwriting generation test.

# Notes
This project is very much incomplete. Many dependencies have not been documented
and many pieces of the code are not written. The only module that really works at
this point is the DataLoader module in the utils dir.

I have only written code for the unconditional model, which is in models/model.py.

# Some Dependencies
If version is not listed, assume latest version.

python 3.x+ (this breaks the utils/\_\_init\_\_.py, but I used python 3 for all the code I wrote)<br>
pytorch<br>
numpy<br>
